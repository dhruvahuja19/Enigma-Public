As a part of CS61B: Data Structures and Algorithms, I recreated the "Enigma" Communication Device used in WWII in Java. The program is fully capable of encrypting/decrypting messages with any given alphabet. Moreover, it's optimized through polymorphism which allows for several different rotor types and configurations.<br>

As for contributors, I worked on the project alone, however was given utility functions and classes by course staff

**I'm not allowed to post the code publicly but can send it to any potential employer, so feel free to reach out!**
